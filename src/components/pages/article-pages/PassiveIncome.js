                <li>
                  Look for a market opportunity:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Harness the skills and passion that you possess, and then
                      look to tie them to a market opportunity that already
                      exists.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Avoid making a product that doesn’t have some signals of
                      existing market interest.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Set realistic goals:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Set production goals. Goals should not be tied to income
                      at this point, but instead to completing the project
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dedicate some time:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If you work on it when you feel like it, your interest
                      will most likely wain after a few weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Dedicate set hours every day or week to achieving your
                      goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Get up for a few hours early, before work or stay up a few
                      hours later at night when everyone else has gone to bed.
                      Set aside specific time and spend it working on your
                      project.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Start quickly:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Don’t wait. Start now!</li>
                    <li>
                      There will never be a perfect moment to start work on
                      something.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep it rough:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Keep the first draft (or beta version) rough. Don’t let
                      perfectionism get in the way to early.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It’s better to get a rough version of something out in the
                      world so you can see what the response is then to never
                      lunch a perfect version.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </article>
